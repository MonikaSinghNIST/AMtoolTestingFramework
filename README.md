Digital forensic investigation is becoming more challenging day-by-day due to rapid growth in the volume of obtained data on an incidence. Approximate matching algorithms are used to assist the digital investigation process by filtering out the relevant data from the total encountered data. Approximate matching is a relatively new area. In the past several algorithms have been proposed to perform the filtering. In order to identify the capabilities of proposed algorithms, it is important to have a systematic method to evaluate the abilities of existing and future algorithms.<br>
This tool can be used to assess existing and future algorithms on four pragmatic test-cases. Each test-case performs the evaluation on the following metrics: false-positive rate, false-negative rate, precision, recall, F-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). In order to understand the true capabilities of an algorithm, it is important to evaluate them on a real-world dataset. Our tool provides a real-world dataset for each test case. It also provides an automated way to generate a real world dataset, which can be used for further research in this area
